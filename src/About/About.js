       <p > My favorite class in college was Computer Science, and I've always gravitated towards roles that have analytical and technical challenges. I currently work full time as a Technical Project Manager, and one year ago, I made the exciting decision to invest in a part time coding bootcamp. <br/><br/>After work & on the weekends, I'm studying Javascript, React, Node, and Express. I'm also learning about jQuery, HTML, CSS, responsive design, mobile-first design, testing with Mocha and Chai, deploying API servers with Node & Express, PostgreSQL, and more.  </p>
